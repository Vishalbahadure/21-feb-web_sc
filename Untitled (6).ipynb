    "Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "Flask is utilized in Web Scraping projects to create a web application that can display the scraped data in a user-friendly manner. By integrating Flask, you can develop a web interface to showcase the extracted information, making it accessible and interactive for users. Flask's lightweight nature and simplicity make it an ideal choice for building such applications quickly and efficiently. Additionally, Flask allows for easy integration with Python scripts responsible for scraping data, enabling seamless communication between the scraping logic and the web interface. This integration enhances the overall user experience and provides a convenient way to visualize the scraped data."
